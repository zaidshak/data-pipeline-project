About

This repository lays the foundational step for a data pipeline architecture that is data-ingestion. 
In this project I've implemented Docker for continuously fetching data (ingestion) from an API(OpenWeatherMap).
Project includes two filea-  a Python script for data fetching with API integration and a Dockerfile for containerization.
Python script fetches data - London city weather for further analyzing and processing.
Future scope would be to implement docker for processing and analyzing the data and deploying it.
